						OtaByte itself was like a joke while it already launched Ohayou Post
						even they barely maintained since OtaByte was never making profit in
						the first place. X was aware of this situation since many “project”

						director board were also playing a role in SABAKO.

						X was hesitate at first but after being violently virtual abused,

						Who you say might rather difficult to answer, but as I’m the X
